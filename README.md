# Mapping for a Sustainable World

## About

[_Mapping for a Sustainable World_](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898) is an open access cartography book teaching the principles of cartography through the United Nationsâ€™ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Formed in 2015 as an extension of the 2000 Millenial Goals, the United Nations identified 17 goals in an effort to address, collectively, the most pressing problems facing our world. _Mapping for a Sustainable World_ includes four sections and 51 chapters on the SDGs and geospatial data, map design considerations, maps and diagrams, and map use environments. The book has an editorial team comprising writers from the International Cartographic Association (ICA) and the Geospatial Information Section of the United Nations (UN). Editorial members include Menno-Jan Kraak (ICA), Robert E. Roth (ICA), Britta Ricker (ICA), Ayako Kagawa (UN), and Guillaume Le Sourd (UN).

## Figure Data & Design Archive

This repo archives UW Cart Lab data and design materials for the book as part of the open educational resource. Data were downloaded from the [United Nations SDG Indicators 
Database](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/), which is continuously updated and maintained. Archived datasets reflect the version used for figures in _Mapping for a Sustainable World_ to enable their exact replication from the book. 

The UW Cart Lab also provides the [_Mapping for a Sustainable World: QGIS Technical Supplement_](https://github.com/uwcartlab/MappingSDGsTechnicalSupplement) to walkthrough how to recreate these figures using the QGIS open source mapping software. All archived materials, including the QGIS Supplement and contents of the Mapping for a Sustainable World cartography book, are available for classroom or workshop use following a CC BY-NC license.
