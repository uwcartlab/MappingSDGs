## About

[_Mapping for a Sustainable World_](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898) is an open access cartography book teaching the principles of cartography through the United Nationsâ€™ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Formed in 2015 as an extension of the 2000 Millenial Goals, the United Nations identified 17 goals in an effort to address, collectively, the most pressing problems facing our world. _Mapping for a Sustainable World_ includes four sections and 51 chapters on the SDGs and geospatial data, map design considerations, maps and diagrams, and map use environments. The book has an editorial team comprising writers from the International Cartographic Association (ICA) and the Geospatial Information Section of the United Nations (UN). Editorial members include Menno-Jan Kraak (ICA), Robert E. Roth (ICA), Britta Ricker (ICA), Ayako Kagawa (UN), and Guillaume Le Sourd (UN).
